# Code Review

1. `General` - Do not forget to add a LICENSE to your project for copyright protection.
2. `.env.example` - Instead of displaying your values here you can add those values into the installations description.
3. `README.md` - Readme file has not been filled in with installation description and testers, this is one of the criteria so don’t forget to do this.
4. `General` - The project generated an error saying that the favicon couldn’t load.
5. `General` - To make the game more user friendly perhaps add some more instructions on how to play the game.
6. `General` - We were not able to redeem any vouchers, perhaps have look at that.
7. `index.ts:3` - You use descriptive variable names so this comment is unnecessary. 
8. `Game.ts:54`- Remember to remove code that is not in use. 
9. `voucher.ts:21-23` - Remember to remove the comments on rows from 21 to 23.
10. `Praise` - Overall great job. We enjoyed playing your game! You have a good file structure and descriptive variable names.
